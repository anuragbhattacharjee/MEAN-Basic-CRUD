# MEAN-Basic-CRUD
A basic application with MEAN stack
It may come helpful for the beginners. 

I have used Angular 5 as a client side. The client side runs seperately in localhost:4200
for running the client side go to the client folder and run 'ng serve'

The express & node runs seperately on localhost://3000
to run that , I have used nodemon. nodemon keeps track of the changes. So, that we don't have to restart the server everytime. 

run 'nodemon' seperately on the mytasklist folder. 

This is also an example of how to use CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) . 

for mongo I have used mlab. You can open your account and host you db for free.
